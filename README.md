# Project-BancoDigitalDIO
This project was done during DIO's QuÃ©bec Java Digital bootcamp and is a simple digital banking system that was designed to put the 4 pillars of POO into practice.
#Challenge Description
> Strengthen your knowledge of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java with a totally hands-on design challenge. For this, the pillars of object orientation are properly explored in the banking context, where the expert implements a reference project (available on GitHub) in a practical and interactive way. Therefore, you can develop your capacity for abstraction by reproducing this solution. Also, if you want to go further, implement your own evolutions and improvements.
